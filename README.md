#Web-Term

A webapp to stream terminal processes to the browser.

To install:

- `git clone https://github.com/dbh937/web-term.git`
- `npm install`

To run:

- `node app.js`

##WARNING
This app gives ANYONE shell access to the host computer as the user the program is run with, with all of those permissions.

***I have no idea what I'm doing.*** Trusting this code to run on your computer is your own decision, and I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result. There will be more security precautions in the future, but as of now, there are NONE.
